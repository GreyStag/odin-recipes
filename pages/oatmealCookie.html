            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                ½ cup (100g granulated sugar)
            </li>
            <li>
                2½ cups (250g) certified gluten free old fashioned rolled oats
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup (218g) packed light brown sugar 
            </li>
            <li>
                6 ounces raisins
            </li>
            <li>
                10 tablespoons unsalted butter
            </li>
            <li>
                2 (100g(weighed out of shell)) eggs at room temperature
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cardamom, and whisk to combine well. Add the granulated sugar and oats, and whisk again to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the brown sugar and mix, breaking up any lumps in. Add the butter, and mix with a large spoon, pressing down with the back of the spoon to moisten the other ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Blend eggs, vanilla and raisins until thoroughly combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the egg mixture to the rest of the ingredients until the dough comes together. It will be very thick, and a fairly sticky but continue to alternately press the cookie dough with the back of spoon spoon and stir, until the dry ingredients are nearly absorbed.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you would like you can now add more (solid) raisins, or chocolate/butterscotch chips and mix to distribute the chips evenly throughout and until the dough is completely integrated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces, each about the size of a golf ball, on the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press each piece of dough with the palm of your hand to flatten it into a disk of about 3/4-inch thick. Place the baking sheets in the freezer until firm, about 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once chilled, place the baking sheet in the center of the preheated oven, and bake for about 12 minutes, or until lightly golden brown all over (and a bit browner around the edges).
            </li>
            <li>
                The cookies will still be soft to the touch. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet until firm (about 10 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
            </li>
        </ol>
